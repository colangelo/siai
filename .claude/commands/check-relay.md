description: Check the agent relay (file inbox + Gitea agent-relay issues) and handle/report each
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Glob, Write
---

You are the **siai** repo's agent. Check **both** agent-relay channels for
messages addressed to this repo and handle them. Protocol: `agent-relay/AGENTS.md`.
This may run headless (`claude -p --bare`), so everything you need is below.

Repo slug: `ac/siai`. Gitea API base: `https://gitea.cat-bluegill.ts.net/api/v1`.
Get the token: `GITEA_TOKEN=$(printf 'protocol=https\nhost=gitea.cat-bluegill.ts.net\n\n' | git credential fill | awk -F= '/^password/{print $2}')`.

## 1. File inbox

```bash
find agent-relay/inbox -type f -name '*.md' -exec grep -l 'status: new' {} + 2>/dev/null || true
```

For each: read it, do the work, then **archive it** — `git mv` to `agent-relay/archive/`,
set `status: done`, append a `## Resolution` section (what you did + commit refs). Reply
to the sender's inbox if a response is warranted. Commit + push.

## 2. Gitea issues labelled `agent-relay`

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITEA_TOKEN" \
  "https://gitea.cat-bluegill.ts.net/api/v1/repos/ac/siai/issues?state=open&labels=agent-relay"
```

For each open issue: read it (+ its comments), then do the work it asks.

**Then — ALWAYS report back. Never act silently** (an unreported issue is a lost one):

1. **Post a comment** stating the **conclusion OR inconclusion** — what you did + commit
   refs, or, if you couldn't finish, *why* and *what is still needed*:

   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITEA_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST "$BASE/repos/ac/siai/issues/<N>/comments" -d '{"body":"…"}'
   ```

2. **Update labels + state** (resolve label IDs first via `GET .../repos/ac/siai/labels`;
   use `PUT .../issues/<N>/labels {"labels":[<ids>]}` to set the final label set):
   - **Resolved** → set labels to `[]` (drops `agent-relay`) and **close**:
     `PATCH .../issues/<N> {"state":"closed"}`.
   - **Inconclusive / blocked** → set labels to `[<agent-blocked id>]` (drops `agent-relay`,
     adds `agent-blocked`) and leave it **open**.

Dropping `agent-relay` once processed is what stops the 10-min poller from reprocessing
the same issue forever; `agent-blocked` keeps an unresolved one findable.

## 3. Report

If neither channel had anything new, say so plainly ("no new relay messages"). Otherwise
summarise, per message, what you concluded (or why it's now `agent-blocked`) — this output
is the audit trail when run headlessly.
